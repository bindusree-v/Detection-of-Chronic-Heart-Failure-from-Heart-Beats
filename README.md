# Detection-of-Chronic-Heart-Failure-from-Heart-Beats
This project focuses on collecting heartbeat audio recordings (.wav files) and using them to train a machine learning model. The model classifies heart sounds into five categories: normal, abnormal, murmur, artifact, and extra heart sounds (extrahls), enabling early cardiac condition detection.
